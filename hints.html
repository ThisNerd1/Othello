        <h4>Corners</h4>
        Discs played in the corners can't be flipped. If you can't take a corner, you can reduce its effectiveness by taking the squares adjacent to it.
        If your opponent places his piece in the spot that is directly adjacent and diagonal to the corner and it's in the beginning or middle of the game, all you need is for any piece in that diagonal line to be your color for you to jump onto the corner.
        The effectiveness of a corner can, however, be diminished by the opponent's maneuvering a solid defense in against it. While a corner is undoubtedly a strong position, it is not necessarily true that gaining one or more corners assures winning the game.
        The squares directly adjoining the corners are also important. By taking these positions, it is possible to defeat the strength of the corners.

        <h4>Disc Minimization</h4>
        Under most circumstances, the player who has the fewest discs is winning. As a consequence, good Othello players will often choose moves which flip as few discs as possible, preferably only one.
      </li>

        <h4>X Squares</h4>
        You protect the corners by avoiding the "X" squares. These are the squares surrounding a corner.

        <h4>Keep Balanced Edges</h4>
        The next most important squares to control after the corners and the spaces adjacent to them are the edges of the board.
        The edge rows can always be used to outflank the inner rows.
        An unbalanced edge can be attacked by a skillful player who will give you a corner in order to take the other corner and the whole edge in between.
      </li>
      <br/>
      <li>
        <h4>Watch Out For The "Danger Zone"</h4>
        The next rows in from the four edge rows, could be considered a "danger zone", since a disc in these rows could be your opponent's bridge to a corner or an outside edge position.
        The darker dots on the board indicate this "danger zone".
